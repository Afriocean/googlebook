# Googlebook

 React-based Google Books Search app.
 
 Built with React components, this works with helper/util functions, and it utilizes React lifecycle 
 methods to query and display books based on user searches. MERN Stack Node, 
 Express and MongoDB was also used so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
